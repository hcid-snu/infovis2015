		<p>This treemap visualizes different languages, among all the existing ones, dominantly spoken by population of over 1 million. Each language is graphically arranged by color, and the languages with similar affiliation were described in same tones of colors. In addition, the area of each portion was set to be with respect to numbers of population using that corresponding mother language. As of now, it is reported that the majority is Chinese-affiliated languages and that English and Spanish, as single-channel languages, account for significant area within this treemap. As a reference, instead of all different kinds of existing languages, only the languages used by population of at least 1 million are represented in this treemap.</p>
