		<div id="description">
This heatmap is to represent the clustering result of gene expression dataset of rice. For both normal and drought-resistant rice phenotypes, gene expression values are measured at 0, 1, 6 hours after drought stress. 
Genes are clustered according to the label of log fold change (gene exp. value of drought-resistant rice divided by that of normal rice). The labels for log fold change is as follows:<br>
C - consistant<br>
U - up-regulated (log fold change above 1)<br>
D - down-regulated (log fold change below -1)<br> 
Label is assigned for each time point and a combination of three labels (for three time points) corresponds a cluster.
Heatmap above shows log fold changes of 25 representative genes in cluster CCD and CUU.
