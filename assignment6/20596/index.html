		<p>Between is an app for couples which has been in service since 2011. A major upgrade to Between 2.0 took place in December 2013. This treemap shows the change in breakdown(by country) of Between yearly active user (YAU) between 2013 and 2014. Although the visualization is not appropriate for comparison in absolute terms, one can see that the weight of global users outside of Korea has grown, most significantly in Taiwan (9x) </p>
